            <p>This document gives you basic information needed in order to configure your router for routing IP, such as
                how addresses are broken down and how subnetting works. You learn how to assign each interface on the
                router an IP address with a unique subnet. There are many examples to help tie everything together.</p>

            <header>Understanding IP address</header>
            <p>An IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. The address is made
                up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet
                mask. The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and
                separated by a period (dot). For this reason, an IP address is said to be expressed in dotted decimal format (for
                example, 172.16.81.100). The value in each octet ranges from 0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 − 11111111
                binary.</p>
                <p>Here is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a
                    value of 2 0 . The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2 1 . This continues until the left−most bit, or most
                    significant bit, which holds a value of 2 7 . So if all binary bits are a one, the decimal equivalent would be 255
                         as shown here:</p>
                         
            <code>
                <pre>
                    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
                    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 (128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255)
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>And this is sample shows an IP address represented in both binary and decimal.</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    10.    1.      23.    19       (decimal)
               00001010.00000001.00010111.00010011 (binary)
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>These octets are broken down to provide an addressing scheme that can accommodate large and small
                networks. There are five different classes of networks, A to E. This document focuses on addressing classes A
                to C, since classes D and E are reserved and discussion of them is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
       <p>Note: Also note that the terms "Class A, Class B" and so on are used in this document to help facilitate the
        understanding of IP addressing and subnetting. These terms are rarely used in the industry anymore because
        of the introduction of classless interdomain routing (CIDR).</p>
        <p>In a Class A address, the first octet is the network portion, so the Class A example in Figure 1 has a major
            network address of 1.0.0.0 − 127.255.255.255. Octets 2, 3, and 4 (the next 24 bits) are for the network
            manager to divide into subnets and hosts as he/she sees fit. Class A addresses are used for networks that have
            more than 65,536 hosts (actually, up to 16777214 hosts!).</p>
            <p>In a Class B address, the first two octets are the network portion, so the Class B example in Figure 1 has a
                major network address of 128.0.0.0 − 191.255.255.255. Octets 3 and 4 (16 bits) are for local subnets and
                hosts. Class B addresses are used for networks that have between 256 and 65534 hosts.</p>
            <p>In a Class C address, the first three octets are the network portion. The Class C example in Figure 1 has a
                major network address of 192.0.0.0 − 233.255.255.255. Octet 4 (8 bits) is for local subnets and hosts − perfect
                for networks with less than 254 hosts.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Network_Masks">
                <header>Network Masks</header>
                <p>A network mask helps you know which portion of the address identifies the network and which portion of the
                    address identifies the node. Class A, B, and C networks have default masks, also known as natural masks, as
                    shown here:</p>
                    <code>
                        <pre>
                            Class A: 255.0.0.0
                            Class B: 255.255.0.0
                            Class C: 255.255.255.0
                        </pre>
                    </code>
                    <p>An IP address on a Class A network that has not been subnetted would have an address/mask pair similar to:
                        8.20.15.1 255.0.0.0. To see how the mask helps you identify the network and node parts of the address,
                        convert the address and mask to binary numbers.</p>
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                8.20.15.1 = 00001000.00010100.00001111.00000001
                                255.0.0.0 = 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
                                
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                        <p>Once you have the address and the mask represented in binary, then identifying the network and host ID is
                            easier. Any address bits which have corresponding mask bits set to 1 represent the network ID. Any address
                            bits that have corresponding mask bits set to 0 represent the node ID.</p>
                            <code>
                                <pre>
                                    8.20.15.1 = 00001000.00010100.00001111.00000001
                                    255.0.0.0 = 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
                                    netid = 00001000 = 8

                                </pre>

        <section class="main-section" id="Subnetting">
            <header>Subnetting</header>
            <p>Subnetting allows you to create multiple logical networks that exist within a single Class A, B, or C network.
                If you do not subnet, you are only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which is
                unrealistic.</p>
                <p>Each data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every node on that link being a member of
                    the same network. If you break a major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnetworks, it allows you to
                    create a network of interconnecting subnetworks. Each data link on this network would then have a unique
                    network/subnetwork ID. Any device, or gateway, connecting n networks/subnetworks has n distinct IP
                    addresses, one for each network / subnetwork that it interconnects.</p>
                    n order to subnet a network, extend the natural mask using some of the bits from the host ID portion of the
address to create a subnetwork ID. For example, given a Class C network of 204.17.5.0 which has a natural
mask of 255.255.255.0,
<code>
    <pre>
        
                204.17.5.32 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  1 to 30
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  33 to 62
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  65 to 94
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  97 to 126
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  129 to 158
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  161 to 190
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  193 to 222
                204.17.5.64 255.255.255.224  host  address  range  225 to 254 


    </pre>
</code>
<p>Note: There are two ways to denote these masks. First, since you are using three bits more than the "natural"
    Class C mask, you can denote these addresses as having a 3−bit subnet mask. Or, secondly, the mask of
    255.255.255.224 can also be denoted as /27 as there are 27 bits that are set in the mask. This second method is
    used with CIDR. With this method, one of these networks can be described with the notation prefix/length.
    For example, 204.17.5.32/27 denotes the network 204.17.5.32 255.255.255.224. When appropriate the
    prefix/length notation is used to denote the mask throughout the rest of this document.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="CIDR">
            <header>CIDR</header>
            <p>Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) was introduced to improve both address space utilization and routing
                scalability in the Internet. It was needed because of the rapid growth of the Internet and growth of the IP
                routing tables held in the Internet routers.</p>
                <p>CIDR moves way from the traditional IP classes (Class A, Class B, Class C, and so on). In CIDR , an IP
                    network is represented by a prefix, which is an IP address and some indication of the length of the mask.
                    Length means the number of left−most contiguous mask bits that are set to one. So network 172.16.0.0
                    255.255.0.0 can be represented as 172.16.0.0/16. CIDR also depicts a more hierarchical Internet architecture,
                    where each domain takes its IP addresses from a higher level. This allows for the summarization of the
                    domains to be done at the higher level. For example, if an ISP owns network 172.16.0.0/16, then the ISP can
                    offer 172.16.1.0/24, 172.16.2.0/24, and so on to customers. Yet, when advertising to other providers, the ISP
                    only needs to advertise 172.16.0.0/16.</p>
